This is my project for TISB HACKS 2021

For this hackathon my aim was to create a user-friendly diagnostic program able to identify everyday illnesses, from the inputted symptoms. I have used the NHS database for everyday ailments and transffered them to an SQLITE database.

FOR THE PROGRAM TO WORK, PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE PROGRAM AND THE SQULITE DATABASE IN THE SAME FOLDER WHEN RUNNING THE PROGRAM. ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED A PYTHON-PATH
